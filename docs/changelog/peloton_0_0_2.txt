Changes to Version 0.0.2
------------------------

* Example TestService no longer requires BAMBI flag set to run
* Simplified startup procedure for workers and removed internal 
  hooks for maintaining multiple versions of service 'hot' as this
  is un-necessary, complicating and resulted in too much  cruft code.
  There are other, better, simpler mechanisms for version  management
  less likely to result in confusion.

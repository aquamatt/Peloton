Changes to Version 0.0.2
------------------------

* Example TestService no longer requires BAMBI flag set to run
* Simplified startup procedure for workers and removed internal 
  hooks for maintaining multiple versions of service 'hot' as this
  is un-necessary, complicating and resulted in too much  cruft code.
  There are other, better, simpler mechanisms for version  management
  less likely to result in confusion.
* Configuration system no longer uses configobj but has python-format
  files and simple structure to replace the complex and hideous
  hierarchy that was imposed previously.
* peloton.utils.json removed; new dependency on simplejson
* patches removed - Twisted 8.1.0 is the minimum 8 series version to
  be used.

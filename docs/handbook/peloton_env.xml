	<title>The Peloton Environment</title>
	<para>
		&peloton; is intended to be a cross-platform product, working anywhere
		that Python and the &peloton; dependencies will run. In principle this
		certainly covers both Microsoft Windows&trade; and Linux. 
	</para>
	<para>
		Development thus far has been on Linux however, so the operational state on
		other platforms has yet to be determined. Notes, comments and observations
		from the community will be most welcome in this regard.

  <title>Kernel plugins</title>
  <para>
    Much functionality in &peloton; is provided via kernel plugins; the 
    message bus interface is one example of such a plugin. Plugins
    may be written quite easily to add novel core functionality to 
    the &peloton; PSC. Kernel plugins run in the main event thread
    of a PSC and are 'risky' in that they have the capacity seriously
    to impede the functioning of a mesh. They should not be used to
    provide what is really 'service' functionality, but when well
    chosen, kernel plugins should allow developers to push 
    the &peloton; system in interesting and novel directions.

    Documentation will follow regarding the writing of plugins... please 
    see the <filename>plugins</filename> package for examples of core plugins
    that form part of the default &peloton; distribution.
